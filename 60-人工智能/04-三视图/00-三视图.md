- Edit: controlNet works great with this. Charturner keeps the outfit consistent, controlNet openPose keeps the turns under control.
- Three versions, scroll down to pick the right one for you.
- If you're unsure of what version you are running, it's probably 1.5, as it is more popular, but 2.1 is newer and gaining ground fast.
